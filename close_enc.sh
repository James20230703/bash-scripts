#!/bin/bash

# This script complements open_enc.sh and is used to unmount the encrypted partition and optionally encrypt
# the partition header providing some plausible deniability.

# 4Mb is copied from the drive header and then encrypted using openssl and the keyfile and written back.

# Openssl is configured so that the header size does not change. No padding or salt is used. Probably not the
# most secure option however if it's size were to change it could overwrite more data and actually corrupt the
# drive.

# Encrypting the header in this way is not intended to secure the underlying data, that is done by the LUKs
# encryption itself.

# This additional process is intended to obscure the header of the drive from forensic analysis by implying
# that the drive contains only random/unformatted data. Iâ€™m not a forensic examiner so this may not be the
# right way to achieve this - this script was written as an experiment

# This script is provided as is and without any warranty. Use it at your own peril.
# It should not be used in a serious security setup unless you have validated the code and are happy with how it
# works and the limitations therein.

# You are free to use, edit and redistribute as you see fit.
